TO DO
- Add "open_note" button in my_notes.jsp
- Add a "back to home" button for each page in students and teachers
- Create a many to many association between teacher and course. A teacher can specialize in many courses and a course 
can be a specialization subject by many teachers.    

CLASSES + DATABASE (18 NOV - 22 NOV)
- Implement classes
- Insert dummy data into database

JSP CONTROLLER PAGES AND LINK WITH BACKEND (3 DEC - 15 DEC)
- Create controller pages that answer to forms
- Error handling
- Implement live chat

ADDITIONAL FIXES (10 DEC UNTIL DEADLINE)


FIND TEACHER 
--> User selects course category
--> User types course title and eventually selects one of the course titles from the database that correspond to the course category they have selected.
--> User selects teacher specializations and other filters 
--> In teacher_results.jsp the relevant teachers are displayed. If a teacher has the course_title selected by the user 
as part of their specialization courses then this teacher will be displayed first and the other teachers will be displayed after this teacher.
