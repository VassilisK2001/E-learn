FIND TEACHER 
--> Load the course titles that belong to the course category the user has selected
--> Preprocess the entered course title and loaded course titles: remove stopwords, convert to lowercase and tokenize text using Apache Lucene library
--> Calculate course titles embeddings: use DL4J library to load pretrained embedding model and compute embeddings by averaging word vectors for each course title.
--> Calculate cosine similarity between user course title and all course titles loaded from the database 
--> In teacher_results.jsp:
    --> If there are teachers whose specialization courses have cosine similarity score of at least 0.7 with user course title then keep those teachers 
    --> If there are no such teachers, then keep  teachers that have the same teacher specialization with the one selected by the user.
